      <description>You seems to have discovered my site The time I&amp;rsquo;m writing this, the website is not planned to be publicly announced. This is my first trial in publishing a personal website. I am currently teaching data science and building stuff at Algoritma. I enjoy fiddling with data and codes (a bit of coding with a lot of praying and googling). The handsome avatar in the top left you are looking right now is Bolin, my cat, please shower him with lots of love.</description>
