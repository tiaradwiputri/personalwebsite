Today marks the second month of working from home initiative. My takeaway is: "It is mentally draining and hard to keep yourself motivated". Some people have this as their regular routine, but most people, myself included, are required to develop a new set of self-management skills to keep our productivity in check. Here are some of the main topic that I get to identify by this experience:

## 1. It's hard to keep track of the priorities
*Required skill: Better personal timetable design*
All information seems to come spontaneously due to the sense of "flexibility" in the working hours. When working in the office, I personally have more advantages in bidding my own priorities by involving the stakeholders and get everyone's on the same page. Unfortunately, that is not the case in remote working. It takes too much time to gather everyone just to set a timetable that complies to everyone's expectation. Due to this limitation, I am required to devise  a personal timetable that can be easily communicated to the entire team and allow other people to rearrange themselves in the available slots. The fundamental difference is that on office working, personal timetable is rarely meant to be communicated, while on remote working, we need to have a personal timetable that could tell our priorities to others. In regards to this, there are some tricks I have tried to implement:
- Have 2 hours of buffer time everyday to give slot to any unexpected work requests and use the remaining time to drag the next thing on your to-do list as to free up upcoming works. This could solve the the tendency of works piling up at the end of the week.
- List all probable requests in the beginning of the week to have a clear basis in rejecting unreasonable requests.
- Have no more than 2 major focus each day to reduce the amount of energy spent on context switching.
- Keep the "non-essential focus" in the beginning or the end of your day.
- Allow yourself to have the right in setting your own timetable that refers to your own capacity and let the rest of the team learn to work with it. Put effort to stay consistent to your timetable to keep it reliable for others.

## 2. ‘Read the room’ skill is now obsolete and needs new approach.
*Required skill:  effective remote communication.
Some people may not be used with the lack of direct conversation we have now. For some people, this could introduce the anxiety of having the thought that some of the colleagues might act unprofessionally. The closest possible substitute option for the direct conversation we have now is video conference meeting. During this meeting we could simulate our ‘read the room’ skill to identify non-performing individuals who might have trouble in delivering the required tasks. This means addressing concealed disagreement (or any refrained opinions) that could lead to unexpected results; a yes-man colleagues might be the most challenging factor.  However, a poorly prepared video call might be inefficient thus being the new “meeting that could have been an email”. There are, of course, other options that are more compact and efficient in communicating remotely such as text-based media. Here are some points worth to consider:
The most common case is that we are unable to translate text into conversational tone to mediate arguments and present influence.
Differentiating between communication that requires video/voice call and the one that can be adequately communicated through text-based media. 
In addition to the things I’ve mentioned, I find that with the decreasing chance of using ‘read the room’ skill in its conventional context, the initial skill may not be necessary in the long term and can be transformed to *"read the text-based media" and "assume colleague to act professionally"*.

## 3 Missing mundane connections as all communications seem to be work-related
*Required skill: Acknowledging your stress and find a way to channel it*
The most difficult part in work from home for me is having all communications to be work-related and find no intermittent mundane conversations throughout the day. Personally, it is mentally draining and exhausting that it requires me to write a specific section about this. However, this topic may not apply to some people, as everyone treats their professional life differently. For me, I require regular non-work-related conversations from colleagues to re-center and positioned myself—an essential approach for me to keep myself motivated. While some people have no trouble re-centering themselves in this situation, I need to address this as a significant hurdle. Here are the things that I have told myself which help:
- Calling your colleagues to talk about non-work-related topic outside of working hour is okay
- Finding out how their weekend and days go is also okay, they might want to know yours too
- Update them with your personal news is also fine, you might want to know theirs too 
- Find the right person to complain to throughout the day. Work is always stressful and is perfectly humane to find someone or use a media or tools to channel your stress

The idea in this third point is to be able to take some time to acknowledge the root problems that greatly affect your mental capacity. It might take some time at first to *identify the potential problems and then acknowledging it*. This, of course, can be easily listed as the "non-pandemic level of management skill" for some people, which is also true. While it's difficult, this section could serve as a reminder to take some time to have a conversation with yourself in order to acknowledge the hardships you are going through.

The things that I have addressed in this article might only be a small part of all the experiences I find along the way. I wrote this in the fifth week into this routine and then decided to publish this after I had a team-wide talk to address my concern. I hope this writing could help some of them to also re-learn the essential skills in surviving these bizarre circumstances. The pandemic changes a fundamental way of how humans work and interact—and not to be taken lightly—which could affect how humans get accustomed to work and communicate in the long term. There are so many more things to relearn and discover. I genuinely hope the global and national situation could improve in the foreseeable future and we can continue to have a safe environment to work and learn.
