### You seems to have discovered my site

The time I'm writing this, the website is not planned to be publicly announced. This is my first trial in publishing a personal website. I am currently teaching data science and building stuff at [Algoritma](https://algorit.ma/). I enjoy fiddling with data and codes (a bit of coding with a lot of praying and googling). The handsome avatar in the top left you are looking right now is Bolin, my cat, please shower him with lots of love.

### What will you find

I will do my best to commit regulary on this website. The kind of things you will be seeing includes:


- Scribbles of random thought  
- I love cats so there will be cats  
- Camera shots taken probably by me  
- Games, books, techs, and things I might enjoy at the moment  
- Portofolio-oriented professional posts  

Enjoy your time looking around!
